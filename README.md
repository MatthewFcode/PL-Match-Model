## 🚀 Overview

This application predicts upcoming Premier League match outcomes using a hybrid intelligence approach.

### Core Concept

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Machine Learning (Python) | Predicts match outcomes using statistical features such as xG, form, goals, and odds |
| LLM Enhancements | Refines predictions with real-world football knowledge |
| Node.js Backend | Provides a secure production-ready API layer |
| Python Flask API | Runs ML models and scrapers internally without exposing logic | ensuring scalability and a good seperation fo concerns
